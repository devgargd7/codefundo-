Although losses caused due to a natural calamity are unavoidable but yet with proper measures they become minimisable. 
The system we build knows the location through Google Location and sets a large radius around it where a probable disaster might affect the people. Our system focusses on:
1. Prediction - Receiving data and alerts from meteorological department of the country about any upcoming disaster.
2. Identifying high danger areas - The system locates areas, if any, where there are more chances of destruction. Like, in a flood, it will take an image of the contour of that area to be affected and identify any low lying areas.
3. Identifying high density areas - Connecting to the Census reports of that country, we can get the population density, specifically of those high danger areas. This way, the system calculates the population most prone to the calamity and prioritises the help.
4. Alerting the concerned people - The system sends this data about the area wise priority to the rescue teams so that they can plan out where the help should reach first and how should the resources be distributed.
5. Restoration - After the disaster ends, the system will take different satellite images of the affected area and identify the areas affected the most. This will help in rebuilding activities.
